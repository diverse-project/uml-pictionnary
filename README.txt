This version of UML pictionary is distributed under the GPL licence.

UML pictionary comes from a person met in a conference in... maybe 1997... but we do not remember who... we thank him.

Then UML pictionary was developped initially in Rennes by Jean-Marc Jézéquel and Benoit Combemale.

This new version is from François Schwarzentruber.
